# DOM-warm-up

This was an optional exercise from bootcamp at Grand Circus

The directions were vague and left styling up to us. So the color pallette, font, and proportions used were my choice.

Directions included:
1. create a div, set height/width and background color
2. create a function that causes the div to change color when clicked on.
3. create aparagraph element (saying anything) that will disappear when clicked.
4. create another paragraph that said "bye" that will change to "hi" when the cursor enters the field surrounding the text.
5. add a digital clock that will display the time in hours, minutes, and seconds and update every second.
